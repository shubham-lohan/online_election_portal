## Features

>### ER Diagram

* Created an ER diagram for designing the database which helped to get a clear idea and decide the various logic elements needed for building the database.
* Created several entities and relationships between the entities which are necessary for organised functioning in a proper manner.
* Includes a few but necessary weak entities and an essential tertiary relationship which reduce several complexities in the project. 
* A snippet of the ER diagram is provided below:

>### [Database Schema](DBMS%20Schema.pdf)

* Created clear and well-defined schemas for all the necessary entities and relationships which were used for populating the DB.
* Database normalisation was done upto Fourth Normal Form(4NF) to eliminate redundancies, insertion, deletion and update anomalies.

>### Database Population

* Made over 10,000+ data entries into the DB.
* Several relations include attributes of `BLOB` data type for storing documents such as aadhaar card of voters, criminal history of candidates etc.
